With this project I want to deepen my Kotlin skills in the familiar android environment using the MVVM pattern and Room for database connection.
New challenges will be Syncing user data per Google Drive, sending push notifications and implementing a homescreen widget.
Additionaly I want to work in a rather organized and planned way instead of just starting anywhere and working on every part simultaneously.
So I will try to think this project through from beginning to end and create milestones and corresponding issues, that are of course open to agile changes.
